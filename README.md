## Alibaba RFQ Scraper 

This project is a Python-based web scraper that automatically extracts RFQ (Request for Quotation) listings from [Alibaba's RFQ sourcing portal](https://sourcing.alibaba.com/rfq/rfq_search_list.htm?country=AE&recently=Y). It collects details such as product title, description, quantity, buyer info, country, posted time, and quote links, saving all of it into a clean CSV file for further analysis or sourcing intelligence.
